About Me

Hi! I’m Adeniyi Vincent Great, a beginner programmer in java and in Python.

I’m passionate about learning programming step by step, starting with the fundamentals like variables and conditional statements in python. I created this repository to share my learning journey and help other beginners understand how to use if, if-else, and if-elif-else statements in Python.

This repo is part of my effort to practice coding, document my progress, and build a professional GitHub portfolio from the ground up.

I hope this project helps you understand conditional statements better and inspires you to explore Python programming confidently.
